<a name="about" class="anchor" href="#about"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About</h3>

<p>Gluten free foods can be relatively easy to find in Chicago, but not all gluten free foods are made equal.  I hope that these reviews can help you in weeding out the dreadful, and discovering the delectable.</p>

<p>I've been following the #greenmachine on Twitter for quite some time now, admiring the delicious GF cupcake flavors that are available.  Friday turned out to be my lucky day.  I peered out the window at work, and to my pleasant surprise, the #greenmachine was outside!  Although I wanted to try both flavors, I only indulged in the GF pistachio cupcake (GF yellow buttermilk was the other option).  The icing was a bit sweet for my liking, but the cake was moist and flavorful.  There's nothing worse than a GF bread product that just crumbles as you attempt to eat it.</p>

<p>Sprinkles Cupcakes - The only cupcake place in Chicago (and possibly in the USA?) that has a cupcake vending machine!!!  Why does that matter?  That means you can get your cupcake fix at any hour!</p>

<p>The store is adorable, but quite small, thus the line is usually out the door.  This is a popular spot for tourists, thus they don't always know about the cupcake ATM.  Sometimes the line will stretch past neighboring stores, but there won't be a single person at the ATM.  That being said, you may not always find the flavor you're looking for at the ATM.</p>

<p>Sprinkles has one gluten free flavor, which is red velvet - It's designated with a red "G" candy on top.  I'm not a huge red velvet fan, but they definitely have a solid GF recipe.  Plus, the cream cheese frosting is to die for.</p>

<p>Yet another great thing about Sprinkles, they always have some kind of fun promotion going on!  They place golden tickets inside their cupcake boxes (I've actually gotten one!).  The golden tickets can get you anything from free cupcakes to free concert tickets.</p>

<p>I was so excited to find Skinnygirl bars at the store! There are a few delicious gluten free bars out there, but I have never found any with a decent amount of protein. I was lucky enough to find them at Target, but you can of course buy them directly, as well.</p>
