<a name="about" class="anchor" href="#about"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About</h3>

<p>Gluten free foods can be relatively easy to find in Chicago, but not all gluten free foods are made equal.  I hope that these reviews can help you in weeding out the dreadful, and discovering the delectable.</p>

<p>I've been following the #greenmachine on Twitter for quite some time now, admiring the delicious GF cupcake flavors that are available.  Friday turned out to be my lucky day.  I peered out the window at work, and to my pleasant surprise, the #greenmachine was outside!  Although I wanted to try both flavors, I only indulged in the GF pistachio cupcake (GF yellow buttermilk was the other option).  The icing was a bit sweet for my liking, but the cake was moist and flavorful.  There's nothing worse than a GF bread product that just crumbles as you attempt to eat it.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
